##Getting Started With Sublime
A guide for people in a hurry.

## Download and Install

<h3 id="pallet">Opening the Pallet</h3>
The pallet is the fastest way to navigate around __Sublime Text__. To open the pallet on Windows click <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>&#8679;</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and on a Mac the shortcut is <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>&#8679;</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.

### Choose Your Language
Before you begin it's probably best to choose what language you'll be writing in so __Sublime__ can apply the appropriate syntax highlighting. This can be done through the menu, as shown below, but I recommend [opening the pallet](#pallet) and typing in the name of the language you want. 

![syntax](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image021.png) 

For example, if you want to write some JavaScript start typing `javascript` and hit return when the option `Set Syntax: Javascript` is highlighted.

### Change Perspective
You can configure the layout of __Sublime__ in a number of different ways. Clicking on the `View` menu item will show you some of the options but here again I'd recommend using [the pallet](#pallet).
![views](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image022.png)  

In both the menu and the pallet you can see the shortcuts for changing View options.
![better view](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image022a.png) 

####Toggle Menu
turns on and off the menu bar at the top of the window

####Toggle MiniMap
turns on and off the document map on the left hand side. This is especially useful when editing longer documents

####Toggle Tabs
Sublime allows you to edit more than one file at a time. typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd> n </kbd> on Windows or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>n </kbd> on Apple will open a new tab. The tab bar can be hidden using the toggle tabs option

####Toggle Side Bar
The sidebar displays all the files and folders that you currently have open. It's a handy way to manage projects.

####Toggle Status Bar
The status bar is at the very bottom of the screen. It gives you information such as line and column number, spaces-per-tab, and the language that you're currently editing in.

####Toggle Open Files in Side Bar
Does what is says on the tin! This command will toggle open or close all the folders currently in the side bar - especaily handy when you're working with frameworks and more complex projects.



## Install Package Control
Oringinally installing and managing packages in __Sublime__ was a bit of a hassle, but with the addition of __Package Control__ you can now do all of this with out leaving the pallet. This is a once-off operation.

### Go to [PackageControl.io](http://packagecontrol.io)
Click on either the green "Install Now" button to the "Installation" link in the top right to procede to the next step.

###Copy the CORRECT Code
By default, you are shown the script that installs package control for Sublime Text 3 so __make sure you click on the tab for Sublime Text 2__
![st tabs](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image043.png)  

After that it's a simple case of selecting the text and copying it to your clipboard.
![copy](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image044.png) 

###Open The Console
You can use the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd> (or <kbd>ctrl &#8963;</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd>  on Apple) or click on `View > Show Console`

![open console](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image045.png)    

Once it's opened paste the code into the text-box at the very bottom of the screen and hit return.
![succcess](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image046.png)  
If everything has gone correctly then the console shows you a message telling you to restart sublime. 

###Restart(s)
Typically you only need to need to restart once but two or even three restarts is not unheard of depending on what dependencies have to be installed. 
![restart](C:/Users/Domhnall/Desktop/programming/Sublime/img/winblime/image047.png)  
For instance, the portable version required two restarts and then, upon using __Package Control__ for the first time, another restart was required.

###Verify Installation

If you want to double check that __Package Control__ as successfully installed then simply [open the pallet] and start typing `install`. Your should see the option `Package Control: Install Package` filter to the top.
